## Informations about KiTTY 0.75

Each new PuTTY version is a new adventure. Will it be easy or not to merge modifications and new features. Remember KiTTY is a code patchwork made with the combinaison of many, many different sources: many form myself and some from other people.

Almost one year between 0.75 PuTTY version and the previous one. It means many lines of code that were modified. And as it was with the [0.71](0.71.md) version, some patches can not be continued in this new version.

Here are the patches that are not available anymore in KiTTY

* [TuTTY](http://putty.dwalin.ru/) color patch (underlined text in terminal is displayed with different colour)
* [ADB](https://github.com/sztupy/adbputty) patch
* Github Actions automatic build (I know it is note related)

Don't hesitate to contact me if you discover something else weird.

KiTTY source code is available at Github.
